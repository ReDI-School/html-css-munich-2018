<h2>pseudo-class and pseudo-elements</h2>
<p>A pseudo-class is basically a phantom state or specific characteristic of an element that can be targeted with CSS. A few common pseudo-classes are :link, :visited, :hover, :active, :first-child and :nth-child. There are more, and we’re going to see them all in a minute.</p>
<p>Also, pseudo-classes are always preceded by a colon (:). Then comes the name of the pseudo-class and sometimes a value in parentheses.</p>
<p>Pseudo-elements are like virtual elements that we can treat as regular HTML elements. The thing is that they don’t exist in the document tree or DOM. This means we don’t actually type the pseudo-elements, but rather create them with CSS. A few common pseudo-elements are :after, :before and :first-letter.</p>
<h3>Single Or Double Colon For Pseudo-Elements?</h3>
<p>The double colon (::) was introduced in CSS3 to differentiate pseudo-elements such as ::before and ::after from pseudo-classes such as :hover and :active. All browsers support double colons for pseudo-elements except Internet Explorer (IE) 8 and below.</p>

<h3>Some examples</h3>
<ul>
  <li>:link</li>
  <li>:visited</li>
  <li>:hover</li>
  <li>:active</li>
  <li>:focus</li>
  <li>:nth-child</li>
 </ul>
 
 <p>Let's apply four colors to a link and paint the background of the 4th item of a list:</p>
 
 <ul class="example">
 <li>This is <a href="http://google.es">the first item</a></li>
 <li>This is the second item</li>
 <li>This is the third item</li>
 <li>This is the fourth item</li>
 <li>This is the fifth item</li>
 <li>This is the sixth item</li>
 </ul>
